As you've probably already surmised, my name is Ben Hollar. I'm a full-stack software developer living in Cincinnati, 
OH. I'm passionate about designing pragmatic, efficient architectures and user interfaces focused on data visualization
and analysis.

## Professional Work

I've been working as a software developer for over five years, specializing in geospatial data visualization and
analysis tools. I'm comfortable working with various [OGC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium)
data formats and tools including [KML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language),
[GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language), [WFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service)
as well as geospatial imagery defined in [NITF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Imagery_Transmission_Format) or
[GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) files.

I began my career while studying at the **University of Cincinnati**, graduating with a degree in Computer Science in
the spring of 2021. While studying, I worked as a [co-op](https://www.uc.edu/co-op.html) at
[**Etegent Technologies Ltd.**](https://etegent.com), a research and development company that specializes in creating
machine learning and data analytics tools for the Department of Defense.

Since my graduation, I've worked full-time at Etegent as one of the lead maintainers and contributors to a web
application that allows data analysts to identify relationships between geospatial datasets using
[intensity maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map). The application is written using 
[.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)
to provide a database-backed REST API and [Angular](https://angular.io/) and
[CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/) to build the web client interface.

## Personal Life

Even at home, I find myself frequently sitting in front of a computer, watching copious amounts of YouTube videos,
playing single-player video games, crafting my homebrew
[Ghosts of Saltmarsh](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/ghosts-saltmarsh) D&D 5e campaign, or idly dreaming of personal
software development projects.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll likely find me spending time with my girlfriend, Roxanne, and our black
labrador retriever mix, Rudi. We love watching movies, searching for waterfalls on scenic hikes, and playing board games
like [Coup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup) or
[Ravine](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237728/ravine), to name a few.

I also enjoy taking [photos](/photo-journal/) -- especially of wildlife. It's a great excuse to get outside and
appreciate the environment around us. Beyond that, I've also been known to [sing](https://youtu.be/oel1JmjWdgs?t=2083),
play the trombone, and whistle idly almost all day long.

I tend not to post on social media sites, so if you're curious what I've been up to, I recommend checking out my most
recent [blog posts](/posts/) or reaching out to me directly.
