In September 2022, my family went on our fourth trip to Mount Desert Island in Maine, home to both the quaint tourist
town of Bar Harbor and to America's 13th oldest national park, Acadia National Park. It also happens to be one of the
most popular, and for good reason. It offers breathtaking views, varied hiking opportunities, spectacular seafood,
tons of wildlife, and much more to enjoy. Suffice to say, **it is one of my favorite places on Earth.** Below, you'll
find some of my favorite photos from this most recent trip there.

## Sightseeing

There are so many things worth seeing and photographing on Mount Desert Island, and I didn't nearly capture them all on
this trip. This time around, my favorite moments included a 
[lighthouse tour](https://www.barharborwhales.com/lighthouse-cruises/somes-sound-lighthouse-cruise/) on a large 
[catamaran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamaran), enjoying a scenic ride on the
[Margaret Todd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Todd_(schooner)), a four-masted schooner, and stopping along 
[Park Loop Road](https://www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/park-loop-road.htm) to climb over rocky cliffs and enjoy
stunning scenic overlooks.

## Wildlife

There were ample opportunities for birdwatching, one of my favorite things to do while out with my camera. Sea birds
were abundant and easy to spot.

### Seagulls Opening Clams

While walking out on [Bar Harbor's namesake sandbar](https://www.barharbormaine.gov/394/The-Bar-of-Bar-Harbor) early in
the morning -- it's only accessible during low tide -- I witnessed seagulls showcasing surprising ingenuity to open
clams (or mussels?). They would hunt around the wet ground to find clams exposed by the change in tides, pick them up
in their beaks, fly directly upward, and then drop them, landing to collect their reward.

## Family

I would be remiss not to include photos of my family and me enjoying the trip. Without them, I may never have discovered
such a wonderful place, and spending time with them was a very meaningful part of the trip.
